# Lab 3: A web application for tram networks

Advanced Python Course  
Chalmers DAT690 / DIT516 / DAT516  
2025

by Aarne Ranta & John J. Camilleri

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to build a web application replicating some functionalities of apps such as [Västtrafik's Travel Planner](https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/reseplaneraren/).
Your application will:

- display the complete map of tram lines
- highlight shortest paths in terms of time and geographical distance
- calculate total travel time by taking changes into account
- show actual departures from any stop by clicking on it

Here is an example screenshot:

![shortest-path](./app-shortest.png)

In some more detail, here is what the three different screens should look like:

- [home screen](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/home.html)
- [route search form](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/find_route.html)
- [search result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/show_route.html)

Unlike the official app, ours will not have access to the actual timetables, but just to the distances and times as defined in Labs 1 and 2.
This is of course a severe simplification, but on the other hand,
our app will be usable for any transport system that can be
represented by the class `TramNetwork`.
Clicking on the created map will give access to actual traffic information from Västtrafik.

Another difference from the official app is that we only run ours in a safe `localhost` environment.
Thereby we do not have to deal with security issues, and it will also be much easier for all groups to finish the project.

The learning outcomes include:

- visualization with more details on positions and colours
- simple front-end construction with HTML
- putting everything together by using a web application framework, Django
- more details of `graphviz` library, various libraries belonging to the Django framework
- virtual environments, the `venv` module

## Getting started

We will follow the standard worklow for the Django framework.
There are several tutorials available, for instance:

- [Official Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/)
- [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
- [w3schools Django Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/django/)

You can look at these for more information, but this document is aimed to be self-contained and sufficient for the lab.

### Directory structure

For this lab, we will start from a blank slate and build up the project's directory structure step-by-step.
The final structure will look as follows.
The files are obtained as follows:

- copied from [`files`](./files/) in this repository (marked 🔵)
- created automatically by Django (unmarked in the diagram)
- slightly modified from automatic files (marked 🟡)
- explained in detail but written by you (marked 🟠)
- written by you (marked 🔴)
- generated by your code (marked ⚪️)

```

### Create Django project

Now we will prepare our environment, install the Django library, and initialize our Django project.

1. Create a directory for this project (not the same as in course GitHub):

    ```sh
    $ mkdir lab3
    ```

2. Move inside it:

    ```sh
    $ cd lab3
    ```

3. Create a Python virtual environment (maybe not necessary, but the best practice):

    ```sh
    $ python3 -m venv myvenv
    ```

    This will create the directory `myvenv` with lots of things in it, but you don't need to concern yourselves with its contents.
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - on Linux/Mac:

      ```sh
      $ source myvenv/bin/activate
      ```

    - on Windows:

      ```sh
      $ myvenv/Scripts/activate.bat
      ```

      or

      ```sh
      $ myvenv/Scripts/activate.ps1
      ```

      Which of these two commands will work depends on what shell you are using. If unsure, try both.
  
    You should now see the string `(myvenv)` prefixed to your command line prompt.
5. Install the necessary Python libraries into the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    (myvenv) $ pip install django==5.2.7
    (myvenv) $ pip install networkx==3.5
    ```

6. Create a new Django project with:

    ```sh
    (myvenv) $ django-admin startproject mysite .
    ```

    (the last dot `.` is necessary: it refers to your working directory, where it creates a directory named
  `mysite` and the file `manage.py`).

At later times (every time you resume working on the project), only the `activate` step (4) is needed.

### Initialize database

This step is needed to initialize the database:

```sh
$ python manage.py migrate
```

It creates a database (in the file `db.sqlite3`), which is a standard part of any Django project, even if we don't use it in this lab.

### Run web server

Now we can start the web server with:

```sh
$ python manage.py runserver
...
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
...
```

Open the URL above in a web browser to check if the installation succeeded.
You should see a generic Django-generated page, which tells you one important thing: that your server is up and running.

## Create the `tram` Django app

Now that we have a basic Django server set up, it's time to start customising it for our task. For this we will create a Django "app" with the name `tram`:

```sh
$ python manage.py startapp tram
```

This creates the directory `tram`, with a lot of predefined contents, but also many things that you will have to complete with your own code.

To recognize this file in your Django website, add the line:

```python
'tram.apps.TramConfig',
```

to the end of the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `mysite/settings.py`.

### Create model

Create a data model for route searches in `tram/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Route(models.Model):
    dep = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    dest = models.CharField(max_length=200)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.dep + '-' + self.dest
```

Each instance of our model will contain a departure and destination stop, stored as strings.
Then migrate the model to the database:

```sh
$ python manage.py makemigrations tram
$ python manage.py migrate tram
```

You will see that your `db.sqlite3` file has contents now, but they are in a binary format that you cannot read.

**Note:** In this lab, the application does not add any data to the database, but its schema (the `Route` class) is used to structure the queries made via the route search form.
This is known as the _MVT Design Pattern_ (Model-View-Template):

- a **model** (in `tram/models.py`) is a class that defines a type of data
- a **view** (to be added to `tram/views.py`) is a function that processes a user request and returns a template
- a **template** (to be added to `tram/templates/tram`) is an HTML file that shows the data

The database could also be manipulated in the _SQL_ language, but one of the things Django does is generate SQL queries from Python code, so that you usually don't need to use SQL directly. This is known as _ORM, Object-Relational Mapping_.

### Update URL patterns

Edit the generated `mysite/urls.py` so that it contains the following:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('tram.urls')),
]
```

The `admin` URL is used for managing the website and requires a login. You can try and create users and passwords, but this is not needed in this lab.

The second `path` includes the URLs given in our `tram` app.
For this purpose, you have to create the file `tram/urls.py`:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.tram_net),
    path('route/', views.find_route),
]
```

Each path has two required arguments:

- the path extending the hostname (seen in the URL field of the browser)
- the "view", i.e. the function called when this URL is requested

### Create views

In order for `tram/urls.py` to work, you have to edit `tram/views.py`, so that it contains the following:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import RouteForm

def tram_net(request):
    return render(request, 'tram/home.html', {})

def find_route(request):
    form = RouteForm()
    return render(request, 'tram/find_route.html', {'form': form})
```

The former function is all we need to render the start page.
The latter function creates a web form, but does not yet do anything with it; we will return to this later.

Of course, we also need to define the `RouteForm` class and the HTML files.
This is the next topic.

### Create form

In order for the `find_route` view to work, we need to create a corresponding form in `tram/forms.py`:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Route

class RouteForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Route
        fields = ('dep', 'dest',)
```

This new form `RouteForm` is linked to our data model `Route`.
We specifying which fields of the model should be present in the form, and Django will automatically create a web form for us.

### Create templates

The HTML files to be created are actually **templates**, since they contain slots where dynamic data is inserted by the server.
The templates reside in a sub-sub-sub-directory, which has to be created first:

```sh
$ mkdir tram/templates
$ mkdir tram/templates/tram
```

Copy the HTML template files from the [`files`](./files/) folder to the newly created `tram/templates/tram`, so that:

```sh
$ ls tram/templates/tram/
find_route.html    home.html   show_route.html
```

### Create template images

Also create the `images` subdirectory:

```sh
$ mkdir tram/templates/tram/images
```

and copy the tram network image [`gbg_tramnet.svg`](./files/gbg_tramnet.svg) into it.

Note that images in this folder can be used in templates (e.g. `home.html`) but are _not_ served publicly by the web server; i.e. you _cannot_ access it via a web browser using something like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/images/gbg_tramnet.svg`.

Now [run the web server](#run-web-server) again. You will see a home screen with the gorgeous SVG image of Gothenburg tram network.

#### Dynamic images

Our application will dynamically generate a new image for each route that is requested.
Create a subdirectory for these dynamically generated images:

```sh
$ mkdir tram/templates/tram/images/generated
```

To avoid adding any of these generated images to the repository, tell Git to ignore this folder by creating a `.gitignore` file in the top-level folder and add this line to it:

```plain
tram/templates/tram/images/generated/
```

#### Customise image (optional)

If you want, you can replace this standard image with your own one. The script [`create_network_picture.py`](./files/create_network_picture.py) does this for you by calling your own `tram.py` on your own `tramnet.json` file.
You can also try to make the picture nicer by changing positioning and other parameters.
But before doing this, make sure to implement the rest of the basic functionalities!

You can return to image generation in the task where you are expected to change the URLs in the tram stops.
Right now, when you click at them, you should be taken to a Google search about that stop.

### Render dynamic content

The form `find_route.html` does not find any routes yet.
You can submit queries, but when you press "Search", the form just becomes empty without showing any result.

So now we want to add some basic functionality that actually shows the shortest path.
The following things are needed:

1. a "utility" function that actually calculates the shortest path (from Lab 2)
2. an extended `find_route()` function in `tram/views.py` (to be copied from [`files/views.py`](./files/views.py))
3. a template that `show_route.html` shows the route that is found (already copied above)

#### Add utility functions

It is a good practice to create a separate directory for "non-Django" utility functions and create an empty `__init__.py` file in it, so that it is recognized as a package.

```sh
$ mkdir tram/utils
$ touch tram/utils/__init__.py
```

Copy the following Python files from [`files`](./files/) into `tram/utils`:

- `graphs.py`, a mock-up, for the most part to be replaced by your Lab 2 version
- `trams.py`, a mock-up, for the most part to be replaced by your Lab 2 version
- `tramviz.py`, finding the shortest paths and marking them in SVG; for you TODO
- `color_tram_svg.py`, actually making the colouring in SVG, no need for you to touch

#### Update views

Now that you have created the utility files, you can replace the simplified `tram/views.py` with the one given in [`files`](./files/views.py).

Now you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8000/route/>, submit a query and get a response (although this is just using a dummy implementation for now).

## Task 1: Implement shortest path functionality

It is now time to implement the core function in our app: calculating the shortest path between two stops.

Most of this work is to be done in the files in `tram/utils`.
They contain `TODO` comments that instruct you what to do.

The main function in the file `tram/utils/tramviz.py`, imported in `tram/views.py`, is `show_shortest`.
Its task is to:

- find the shortest paths (time and distance)
- use them to colour the stops in the network picture, dynamically generating a new image
- return the shortest paths as strings to be shown in the view
- return the file path to the dynamically generated image

### Add colours

As the example for the [search result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aarneranta/chalmers-advanced-python/blob/main/labs/lab3/examples/show_route.html) page shows, we expect three different colours to be used:

- <span style="color:green">green</span> for stops on the shortest path
- <span style="color:orange">orange</span> for stops on quickest path
- <span style="color:darkcyan">cyan</span> for stops that are on both paths

You can also use some other colours if you prefer.
Other stops should be left white.
The default implementation copied from [`files/tramviz.py`](./files/tramviz.py) is a mock-up, which always shows the same colours and the same route.

You can of course also makes the HTML files look nicer if you have time!

### Account for line changes

In Lab 2 shortest path, we ignored the effect of changing from one line to the other.
This effect is a major factor that can make the "shortest time" and "shortest distance" differ significantly.
Its implementation requires that we recognize when a change must be made and add a suitable number of minutes or meters to the cost.

One way to do this with the existing algorithms is simply to build a new graph for the network, where:

- vertices are pairs `(stop, line)` for each `stop` in the original graph and each `line` than passes through it
- every edge `(a, b)` of the original graph is multiplied to edges `((a, line), (b, line))` for every `line` that serves both `a` and `b`
- edges are added between all vertices that have the same `stop`
- distances and transfer time between different stops are the same as in the original graph
- a special change distance and change time is added between vertices that have the same stop but different times, e.g. 20 metres and 10 minutes respectively

## Task 2: Data validation

You should now have a working application which returns the shortest routes between two stops.
But what happens when you enter a stop name that doesn't exist (e.g. you make a typo)?
The Django server doesn't crash, but you will see an ugly error page and the HTTP response from the server will have status code [500 Internal Server Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#500_internal_server_error).

Instead, we should gracefully handle incorrect user input by returning a more appropriate HTTP status such as [400 Bad Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#400_bad_request) and showing the user a suitable message.

Edit the `find_route` view in your `trams/views.py` file to check for incorrect input and behave accordingly. You can use the following, but the details are up to you:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponseBadRequest
...
return HttpResponseBadRequest(f"Unknown stop name: {stop}")
```

## Task 3: Add links to live traffic information

The main home page image `gbg_tramnet.svg` is not just a static image, but an SVG file which contains hyperlinks.
Currently, clicking on a stop name will search the Västtafik website for that stop name.

Instead, we want clicking on a stop name to take you to Västtrafik's live traffic information page for that stop, for example the [page for Nordstan](https://avgangstavla.vasttrafik.se/?stopAreaGid=9021014004945000) which has URL:

```plain
https://avgangstavla.vasttrafik.se/?stopAreaGid=9021014004945000
```

To do this, we need to:

1. Create URLs for the traffic information page of each stop name, by finding the `Gid` which corresponds to each stop.
2. Update the SVG file to replace the "search" URLs with these traffic information URLs.

### Create URLs

The first challenge is to create the traffic information URLs corresponding to each stop name.
For this, we need the `Gid` of each stop.

An HTML page containing a full list of stop identifiers can be found in the file [`files/hållplatslista.html`](./files/hållplatslista.html).
This file was captured from the original URL <https://www.vasttrafik.se/reseplanering/hallplatslista/>. It may look strange if you open it in your browser, but if you look at the HTML source in your text editor you will see that all stops and their `Gid`s are in fact contained there.
So, your task is as follows:

1. Investigate where and how `Gid`s are given in the HTML document.
2. Extract the `Gid`s of all tram stops from the document.
3. Create traffic information URLs for every stop.
4. Save the stop-URL dictionary as a JSON file.

For step 2, you can use the [standard library for parsing HTML](https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html).
A slightly more convenient third party library which can be used for this is [Beatiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

### Update SVG

After this, you need to create a new SVG image with these new URLs.
To do this:

1. Run [`files/create_network_picture.py`](files/create_network_picture.py) making sure that `TRAM_URL_FILE` and `MY_TRAMNETWORK_JSON` point to your URL dictionary and tramnetwork file, respectively.
2. Move the resulting file `my_gbg_tramnet.svg` to `tram/templates/tram/images/gbg_tramnet.svg`

Note that this only needs to be done once for the entire project (not every time a request to the web server is made).
There is no need to copy `create_network_picture.py` from `files` to `tram/utils` or any such place.

After doing this, make another search in your web application and click at some stop to verify that the link has been updated to take you to the traffic information page for that stop.

## Submission

Submit all the files that are needed to run your application by committing them to your repository,
but take care to **avoid committing automatically generated files**, in particular:

1. the dynamic images in `tram/templates/tram/images/generated/`
2. your local Python virtual environment `myvenv/`
3. cache folders such as `__pycache__/` which can be automatically created by your IDE

You should use a `.gitignore` file to avoid committing such paths to the repository.
The `.gitignore` file itself _should_ be committed to the repository.

### Peer review

Before inspecting your code, we will organize peer reviewing sessions, where each group tests and reviews another group's work.
The review report that you write will be added as a part of your submission.
[More details about peer reviewing](./peer-review.md).
