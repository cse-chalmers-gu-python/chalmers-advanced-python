# Points from labs and their parts

Advanced Python Course, Chalmers DAT515, 2023

by Aarne Ranta

*New in 2023: the exam is the same for everyone, with no extra questions for the extra labs.*

The following table shows how many points can be gained from each lab:

| Lab   | Basic part | Bonus 1 | Bonus 2 |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Lab 1 | **10**         | 2       | -       |
| Lab 2 | **10**         | 4       | -       |
| Lab 3 | **10**         | 4       | 4       |
| extra-colouring  | 6         | 4       | -     |
| extra-clustering | 6         | -       | -     |

The minimum points for different grades are:

- grade 3: 30, consisting of the basic parts of Labs 1,2,3 (in **boldface**)
- grade 4: 40, must include all basic parts of Labs 1,2,3
- grade 5: 50, must include all basic parts of Labs 1,2,3

Thus there is only one way to gain grade 3, but several ways for the higher grades.

In addition to the labs, you will have to pass the exam.
Your final grade is the grade from the labs - provided you have passed the exam.

But don't worry: the exam will be easy for those who have made the labs!
Since the exam is individual, it is still possible that one member or
a group is passed but another one failed.
This is likely to happen only if you have let your partner do all the
job instead of learning the contents yourself.
Failed students can, as usual, take a re-exam later without resubmitting their labs.
